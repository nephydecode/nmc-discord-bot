# Axie Infinity Discord Bot (NMC)

The Axie Infinity Discord Bot is a tool designed specifically for managing users & managers within an Axie Infinity guild - Nox Moon Cardinal (NMC). 
This bot provides a sets of commands tailored to Axie Infinity players, enabling them to easily access information related to their Axies, Matchmaking Rating (MMR), Smooth Love Potion amount (SLP), marketplace links (and more!) directly within the Discord server.

This bot had been maintained by the owners of NMC guild - [@njh18](https://github.com/njh18) and [@nephydecode](https://github.com/nephydecode), previously deployed on [replit](https://replit.com/@njh18/Loops-practice#main.py).
